## Examples

### Access Array Elements
- Demonstrates how to access array elements using different methods such as indexing, `for` loops, and array destructuring.

### Arithmetic Operations
- Shows how to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Array Manipulation
- Contains examples of array manipulation using methods like `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `reverse`, etc.

### Object Manipulation
- Provides examples of how to access and modify object properties using dot notation and bracket notation.

### Functions
- Demonstrates how to declare functions, use function expressions, return values, and handle default parameters.

### Loops and Control Flow
- Examples of different looping mechanisms (`for`, `while`, `forEach`, `for-in`, `for-of`) and control flow statements (`if`, `switch`, `continue`, `break`).

### Error Handling
- Shows how to handle errors using `try-catch` blocks to catch and manage exceptions.

### Inheritance
- Demonstrates class inheritance in JavaScript, including method overriding and constructor functions.

### Advanced Topics
- Covers more advanced concepts such as closures, `map`, `set`, `spread operators`, and other features.
